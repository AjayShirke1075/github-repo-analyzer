## 💡 Optional: Add AI Later

If you get OpenAI credits in the future, you can easily re-add AI features:

1. Add `openai` to `requirements.txt`
2. Uncomment AI code in `app.py`
3. Add AI section back to `index.html`
4. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable

The `utils/ai_suggester.py` file is still in your project for future use.
